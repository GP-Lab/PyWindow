# PyWindow

PyWindow aims to help the engineers to design and analyze spectral windows. We built this tool using Python. The tool opens with a default 64-point Hann window.

# Setup

We used Python 3.7.16 to develop this tool, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11. First you can create an virtual environment using conda:
```python
conda create --name env_name python==3.7.16
```

The codebase also depends on a few pip packages. You can download and install these packages using pip.
```python
pip install -r requirments.txt
```
